![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-black?logo=Python&style=social)

This is a Point of Sale System (POS). It allows a user to accept **Customer**, **Product** and make **purchases**. The aim is to allow the user to keep track of the sales within their system. Imagine you have a store like the Loyverse and you own a small store or Kiosk which acts as a shop or distribution system. In order to track the records and the number of customers making purchases. You would need a Point of Sale system right at your pocket. It would allow you to update inventory records and furthermore make purchases from a customer. 

## Project Description

The POS system has the following functions that can be performed. 

CUSTOMERS 
1. Adding a customer.
2. Deleting a customer. 
3. Viewing the customer records. 
4. Editing/ modifying the customer details. 

PRODUCTS

5. Adding/ inserting a product into the records.
6. Viewing all product items in the record.
7. Deleting a product from the record. 
8. Updating / modifying a product in the records.

PURCHASE

9. Make a purchase. 

The POS system has been written using <code>python 3.10.1</code> and is supporting by versions of <code>python 3.6+</code>. The storing of the data uses the python's <code>csv</code> module.

What the program does is that when we run <code>python main.py</code>, it will first introduce you to the POS system using the menu above for those particular functionalities. 

## Installation
If you are using either Mac OS or Linux you could follow these steps. On your terminal, on Mac you would press **Control + Option + Shift + T** and in linux **Control + Alt + T**. Then copy and paste the command.
```git
git clone https://github.com/Rioba-Ian/Customer_Design_System.git
```
After that you would move into the directory itself. 
```bash
cd Customer_Design_System
```
You would confirm your installation using the <code>ls</code> keyword to list the file directories inside. You would need to have a <code>main.py</code> file in your folder. 

If your installation happened correctly. You would just run the <code>main.py</code> file as follows.
```python
python3 main.py
```
For windows installation would happen abit differently. You would follow the following steps. 

Your windows terminal, is called using the CMD. You would press **Control + R**, it will bring a small dialog box called Run. Write in the dialog menu, <code>cmd</code>. After that a black window menu shall be brought. Inside it, write the following commands. 
```git
git clone https://github.com/Rioba-Ian/Customer_Design_System.git
```
After that you would move into the directory itself. 
```bash
cd Customer_Design_System
```
Also confirm that your installation is correct by using the <code>ls</code> keyword to list the file directories inside. You would need to have a <code>main.py</code> file in your folder.

If this happened correctly, you would need to run the following command:
```python
python main.py
```
If it doesn't run, then python has not been installed correctly. This would mean that either python is not installed or is not in correct path of you <code>#$PATH</code>. I would recommend that you follow this [Link](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows).
